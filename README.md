# HussBot

HussBot is a Discord bot for fetching various statistics for the tactical first-person shooter **Valorant**.  
It integrates with the [HenrikDev Valorant API](https://docs.henrikdev.xyz/) to deliver real-time player stats, match history, and profile information — all directly inside your Discord server.
